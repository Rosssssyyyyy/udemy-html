		<h2 align="left"> You are probably here because you love animals. <br>
		But do you know there are so many domestic as well as wild animals that suffer everyday due to various reasons?
		Our community in states and territories work hard every day to care for animals, through rehoming unwanted and neglected animals through their shelters, educating the public about responsible pet ownership, and, where possible, by supporting injured wildlife.

		<b>SOME FACTS ABOUT ANIMAL CRUELTY</b>
		</h1>
		<img src="i3.jpg" width="500" align="center">
		
			<ol>
				<li>Puppy mills are large-scale commercial dog breeding operations that put greater priority on profits than the health of the puppies. Many dogs are plagued with illnesses like kidney or heart disease as a result of the conditions they’re kept in.</li>
				<li>Dogfighting became prevalent in the US after the Civil War, with professional pits proliferating in the 1860s. And was a source of entertainment for police officers and firemen.</li>
				<li>It’s been estimated that there are 900 to 2,000 new cases every year of animal hoarding in the US, with 250,000 animals falling victim.</li>
				<li>Over 115 million animals – mice, rats, dogs, cats, rabbits, monkeys, birds, among others – are killed in laboratory experiments worldwide for chemical, drug, food, and cosmetics testing every year.</li>
				<li>The exotic pet trade is a multi-billion dollar industry in the US and while some wild pets are bred in captivity, many are taken from their native habitats. The stress of being violently removed from their homes causes a number to die prematurely.<br> <br></li>
			</ol>

			WHAT CAN YOU DO?
		</h1>
		
		
			<ol>
				<li>Adopting a cat or dog or some other animal from a shelter or rescue group helps to reduce animal homelessness.</li>
				<li>Increasing awareness of wildlife poaching, factory farm practices, the treatment of animals in laboratories, homeless cats and dogs and related issues helps to improve the well-being of animals.</li>
				<li>There are numerous online petitions intended to promote animal welfare.</li>
				<li>There are thousands of animal welfare organizations throughout the world almost all of which rely heavily on donations and volunteers.</li>
				<li>Make sure that your vacation plans don’t include causing animals to suffer.</li>
